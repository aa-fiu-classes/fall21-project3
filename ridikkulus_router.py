          the request was received:  `aprPacket.tip == iface.ip`.  If no match, then the request is not for 
          you and should be ignored.
        - if it is response, then you should decode and call self.arpCache.handleIncomingArpReply()

          has and all of such packets should be treated equally).  You can use self.findIfaceByIp() method.
          If no interface found, then this packet is for someone else and you should call self.processIpToForward()

        In our project, one can either send ICMP packets (ping) to the router or it will be
        a UDP packet to a random port when traceroute is used.  Therefore, you need to decode
        ipPacket and determine which is which, ignoring any other types of packets (e.g., TCP).

        You don't actually decode udpPacket, but rather just implement ICMP destination port unreachable response.

        This is the starting point for forwarding a packet according to the routing table rules.
        Here you first need to lookup a routing table (routing table is configured automatically,
        you don't need to do anything, except looking it up + implementation of the longest prefix
        match logic).

        First, check if checksum is valid and TTL is enough to forward.  You need to report errors
        (properly respond with ICMP correct) to the source: need to create new ICMP header, new IP header,
        new Ethernet header, etc.  Don't forget to calculate proper checksums for ICMP and IP headers.

        entry = self.routingTable.lookup()

        The entry has  .dest, .gw, .mask, and .ifName fields. For forwarding, .ifName and .gw will be relevant.

        Assumptions here:
        - if .gw is 0.0.0.0  (you can check   entry.gw == 0), then the packet can be directly forwarded
          to the interface (i.e., the host is directly adjacent).   In this case, you need to lookup
          ARP cache for the origIpHeader.dst (self.arpCache.lookup()), if you have an existing entry,
          then use its info (arpEntry.mac for the new EthernetHeader's destination mac), and then create
          new Ethernet header, reduce TTL, recalculated checksum, create full packet and forward it.

          If arp cache entry doesn't exist, you need to create ARP request, send ARP request, and then
          queue the request: self.arpCache.queueRequest(ip, ipPacket, interfaceLookedUpByRoutingTable).
          Whenever response comes, you will be sending the packet(s) from inside of ridikkulus_arp_cache.py:handleIncomingArpReply

        - if .gw is anything but 0.0.0.0 the process is exactly the same as above, but you need to use
          entry.gw address instead of origIpHeader.dst for ARP cache lookup.  IP header's destination IP
          stays original, .gw only used to lookup MAC address of the gateway!
