Project 3 (Ridikkulus Router)
=============================

(For build dependencies, please refer to [`router_base/Vagrantfile`](router_base/Vagrantfile).)

The starter code includes only the framework to receive raw Ethernet frames and to send Ethernet frames to the desired interfaces.  Your job is to implement the routers logic.

## Note for Gradescope Submission

This project can only be submitted to Gradescope via connection to GitHub (no raw file upload).

## Academic Integrity Note

You are encouraged to host your code in private repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/).  At the same time, you are PROHIBITED to make your code for the class project public during the class or any time after the class.  If you do so, you will be violating academic honestly policy that you have signed, as well as the student code of conduct and be subject to serious sanctions.

## Known Limitations

When POX controller is restrated, the simpler router needs to be manually stopped and started again.

## Acknowledgement

This implementation is roughly based on the original code for Stanford CS144 lab3 (https://bitbucket.org/cs144-1617/lab3).
